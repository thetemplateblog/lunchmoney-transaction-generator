```

## üìö Technical Details

### Architecture

- **Frontend**: Vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- **API Integration**: Direct calls to Lunch Money's REST API
- **No Backend**: Entirely client-side for security and simplicity

### Browser Support

- **Modern Browsers**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge (latest versions)
- **Mobile**: iOS Safari, Android Chrome
- **Requirements**: ES6+ support, Fetch API

### API Usage

The tool uses the following Lunch Money API endpoints:

### Calculation Methods

- **Mortgages**: 
  - Monthly compounding with accurate P&I split
  - Balance decreases each month for proper interest calculation
  - Example: $250k at 7% shows $1,458 interest month 1, $1,457 month 2, etc.
- **Loans**: 
  - Standard amortization formula: P = L[c(1 + c)^n]/[(1 + c)^n - 1]
  - Fixed monthly payments with decreasing interest portion
- **Credit Cards**: 
  - Daily periodic rate: APR/365
  - Effective monthly rate: (1 + daily_rate)^30 - 1
  - Minimum payment: max(3% of balance, $25) + interest
- **Multi-Currency**: 
  - Proper formatting for each currency (e.g., ¬•500,000 not ¬•500,000.00)
  - Currency-specific accounts for proper routing
  - International transaction patterns for realistic data
